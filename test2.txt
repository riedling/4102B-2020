CSE4102 Team Semester Project
Due Dates as Below

For your team semester project, form teams of 2students to explore indepth a programming 
language, and submit a multiple part report and PowerPoint presentation  with Specific 
content/objectives and responsibilities as given as four deliverables: 


A.	Identify the Issues and Questions of your topic by providing a one-page discussion 
of your chosen programming language. Why did you choose your programming 
language? What types of problems does it solve? What application domain means is 
it relevant for? When how and who were the inventors of the programming 
language?


B.	10-15 page final report your chosen programming language.  Expand the one piece 
discussion more detail. Discuss from the perspective of technology perspective,  the 
compiler available and the platforms  the IDE etc.


C.	Demonstrate your chosen programming language through code perhaps using 
word count or word frequency program if relevant.  


D.	40-50 slide PPT presentation on your chosen programming language using the 
CSE4102 template on the course web page.  This presentation should include the 
material from A, B, and C. Note that you also need to prepare a maximum 25 slide 
reduced version for presentation in the class.


The intent is for one team member to be responsible for B in a second team member to be 
responsible for D in both team members to share A and C.

Possible Languages to consider are based on categories or application domains or for 
specific purposes:


1.	Languages for IoT, concurrency/parallelism, machine learning, secure transactions
2.	Categories as in List_of_programming_languages_by_type 
3.	Time period organization as in 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_programming_languages  


You cannot choose any language from the course programming assignments (C, C++, 
Pascal, Modula-2, Ada, Prolog, Go), if it?s covered extensively in class (Fortran, COBOL), 
from a CSE class (Python, scheme), or is  widely in use  (Java, JavaScript, C#, Objective-
C, Swift, etc.).


Make sure you select a language that has an available compiler to utilize for demonstration 
and testing purposes.


Your team needs to get approval by the instructor for the chosen language.


Formatting and Submission Requirements:

*	All slides must be formatted with  cse4102template.pptx 
*	Slide 2 of  cse4102template.pptx has organization of final PPT.
*	For written reports A and B,, 1 page is 12pt, 1in margins, single spaced, Times New 
Roman fonts. You must submit an MS Word Document.
*	For presentations, use PowerPoint.
*	Tables, Figures, etc. are not counted in the page requirements of B.
